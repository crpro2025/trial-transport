# üöÄ DEPLOY TO VERCEL NOW - SIMPLE STEPS

## ‚ö° **FASTEST METHOD (2 MINUTES)**

Since I cannot directly access your Vercel account, here's the **absolute fastest** way to deploy:

---

## üéØ **METHOD 1: VERCEL CLI (FASTEST)**

### **Step 1: Install Vercel CLI**

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

### **Step 2: Navigate to Your Project**

```bash
cd trial-transport
```

### **Step 3: Deploy**

```bash
vercel
```

That's it! The CLI will:
1. Ask you to login (opens browser)
2. Detect it's a Next.js project
3. Deploy automatically
4. Give you a permanent URL

**Total Time: 2 minutes**

---

## üéØ **METHOD 2: VERCEL WEBSITE (5 MINUTES)**

### **Step 1: Create Account**

1. Go to https://vercel.com/signup
2. Click "Continue with GitHub"
3. Authorize Vercel

### **Step 2: Upload Project**

**Option A: Via GitHub (Recommended)**

1. Create GitHub repo: https://github.com/new
2. Name it `trial-transport`
3. Push your code:
   ```bash
   cd trial-transport
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy Trial Transport"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trial-transport.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```
4. In Vercel, click "Import Project"
5. Select your GitHub repo
6. Click "Deploy"

**Option B: Direct Upload (No GitHub needed)**

1. In Vercel dashboard, click "Add New..." ‚Üí "Project"
2. Click "Browse" and select your `trial-transport` folder
3. Click "Deploy"

But I CAN:
- ‚úÖ Prepare all files (DONE)

## üéØ **WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?**

1. **Use Vercel CLI** - I'll give you the exact 3 commands
2. **Use Vercel Website** - I'll guide you through each click
3. **Use GitHub + Vercel** - I'll provide git commands
