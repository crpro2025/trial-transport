## 🎤 ELEVATOR PITCH (WITH TEAM)

**"We're Trial Transport, revolutionizing clinical trial logistics with AI.

The clinical trial logistics market is $8.2 billion and growing to $15.7 billion by 2030. Current solutions are expensive ($150-350 per delivery), have high failure rates (15-20% temperature failures), and lack real-time visibility.

We've built an AI-powered platform that reduces costs by 30-50% while achieving 99.2% temperature compliance through 6 specialized machine learning models analyzing 820+ features.

What makes us unique is our team: Jess Thompson brings 15+ years from Pfizer, IQVIA, ICON, and major research institutions - she's lived these pain points. Jason Long is COO of Clinical Research Pro with deep healthcare technology expertise.

We have a fully functional MVP and are seeking $4M seed funding to complete the platform, achieve FDA/HIPAA compliance, and launch our beta program with 10-15 customers.

We're projecting $6.3M revenue in 2027, $28M in 2028, and break-even by 2029. With our industry relationships and operational expertise, we're positioned to become the market leader in clinical trial logistics."**
